  The Press Freedom Index, yearly produced by Reporters Without Borders, ranks
  countries according to the degree of freedom that journalists, media, and
  netizens have in each country. The score is computed on a scale from 0 (good
  situation) to 100 (very serious situation).




  In 2020, Europe is still the most favourable region for media freedom, despite more and more journalists are suffering the consequences of oppressive policies, assaults, online threats and financial troubles.
