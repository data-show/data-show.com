description: The Press Freedom Index, measured each year by Reporters Without
  Borders, ranks 180 countries according to the degree of freedom that
  journalists, media, and netizens have in each country, based on an evaluation
  of pluralism, media independence, quality of legislative framework,
  transparency and safety of journalists. The final score is defined on a scale
  from 0 to 100, the higher the score of a country, the more worrying the
  situation for that country.
