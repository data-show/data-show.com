description: Socio-economic status is one of the four themes used to calculate
  the overall SVI score, measured as a combination of income, poverty,
  employment and education. Populations of lower socioeconomic status are
  considered to be the most vulnerable when preparing for a possible disaster or
  recovering from a disaster.
