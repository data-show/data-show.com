  The Press Freedom Index, published each year by Reporters Without Borders,
  ranks countries according to the degree of freedom that journalists, media,
  and netizens have in each country. The score is measured on a scale from 0
  (good situation) to 100 (very serious situation).



  In North America, despite a slight improvement in 2020, troubling trends regarding press freedom continue. Journalists and the media continue to face verbal and physical threats, are denied access to information, as laws and lawsuits restricting their rights multiply.
