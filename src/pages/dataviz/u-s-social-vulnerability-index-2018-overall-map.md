title: U.S. Social Vulnerability Index 2018 - Overall Map

description: Social vulnerability refers to the capacity of people or groups to
  anticipate, respond and recover from the impact of external stresses to which
  they are exposed. The SVI uses U.S. Census variables that reflect at-risk
  populations to identify and map vulnerable areas. Using a percentile ranking
  method, each tract receives a separate ranking from 0 (lowest vulnerability)
  to 1 (highest vulnerability). By effectively addressing and reducing social
  vulnerability, we can decrease both human suffering and economic losses.
