description: Social vulnerability references to the capacity of populations to
  be prepared for, react to and get back from the impact of external stresses to
  which they are exposed. The SVI uses U.S. Census data that focus on at-risk
  populations to identify and map vulnerable areas. Using a percentile ranking
  method, each tract receives a separate score from 0, corresponding to the
  lowest vulnerability, to 1 corresponding to the highest vulnerability.
  Addressing and effectively reducing social vulnerability could help limit both
  human suffering and economic loss in the face of disaster events.
