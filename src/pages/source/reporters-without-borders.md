description: "Reporters Without Borders (French: Reporters sans fronti√®res
  (RSF)) is an international non-profit and non-governmental organization that
  safeguards the right to freedom of information. Its advocacy is founded on the
  belief that everyone requires access to the news and information, inspired by
  Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that recognizes the
  right to receive and share information regardless of frontiers, along with
  other international rights charters. RSF has consultative status at the United
  Nations, UNESCO, the Council of Europe, and the International Organisation of
  the Francophonie."
