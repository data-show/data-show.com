Lawful permanent residents (LPRs) are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States, also known as green card recipients.

Nearly 1.1 million persons have been granted Lawful Permanent Resident (LPRs) status in the United States in 2018. Half of these new LPRs were already present on the U.S. territory when they obtained their status. Nearly two-thirds were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or current LPR.
