description: According to RSF’s measures, world press freedom improved very
  slightly in 2019. However, the flagrant attacks on the media and open
  hostility towards journalists in many democracies result in more and more
  frequent acts of violence, intimidation, but also censorship, that create
  worldwide an unprecedented state of fear.

## About the index score

The Press Freedom Index is a ranking of 180 countries published yearly by Reporters Without Borders on the basis of countries' press freedom results according to the organization's own assessment. This ranking attempts to reflect the degree of freedom that journalists, media, and netizens have in each country, and the efforts made by the authorities to respect this freedom.

The World Press Freedom Index is composed of a number of indicators, which are :

* **Pluralism :** Measures the degree to which opinions are represented in the media.
* **Media independence :** Measures the degree to which the media are able to function independently of sources of political, governmental, business and religious power and influence.
* **Environment and self-censorship :** Analyses the environment in which news and information providers operate.
* **Legislative framework :** Measures the impact of the legislative framework governing news and information activities.
* **Transparency :** Measures the transparency of the institutions and procedures that affect the production of news and information.
* **Infrastructure :** Measures the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information.
* **Abuses :** A seventh indicator based on data gathered about abuses and acts of violence against journalists and media during the period evaluated is also factored into the calculation.

The final score is defined on a scale from 0 to 100. The higher the score of a country, the more worrying the situation for that country. The press freedom map presents a visual summary of the performance of 180 countries in the World Ranking.

## The Index region by region

### Europe

Europe remains the continent most in favor of press freedom, despite the repressive policies of certain countries of the European Union and the Balkans. Although several Member States are among those which respect press freedom the best, the EU is increasingly heterogeneous. Undermined by the successive economic crises, the fight against terrorism, but also by States sliding more and more towards a more authoritarian regime, Europe is showing itself less and less credible in this role of example that we could have given him in the past.

### North America

Across North America, despite a slight improvement, worrying trends persist. Journalists and the media continue to face verbal and physical threats, denied access to information, as laws and lawsuits restricting their rights multiply. In the United States, press freedom continues to suffer under Donald Trump's presidency. Indeed, hostility towards journalists and the media grew and intensified, and the most virulent attacks turned out to be those carried out by the president himself. At the dawn of this new decade, the United States urgently needs to regain its credentials in terms of press freedom within and beyond its borders in order to re-position itself as a leading democracy.

### South America

In South America, the decade begins with a general deterioration in the situation of press freedom. The context in which journalists in Latin America operate is increasingly complex and hostile. In addition to the increased pressure, violence and intimidation suffered by many journalists covering sensitive issues, extensive discrediting campaigns have been launched against the profession in most countries in the region. Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, and Mexico remain among the world’s most dangerous places for journalists, who sometimes pay with their lives to investigate corruption or drug traffickers.

### Africa

Africa is recording significant setbacks, due in particular to an increase in long-term arbitrary detentions, but also to attacks, particularly online, and new repressive laws which, in the name of the fight against disinformation or cybercrime, can be used to unreasonably restrict freedom of information. The situation of those who try to produce information is difficult, even critical. The economic weakness of the media also exposes them to political or economic influences detrimental to their independence.

### Asia

The Asia zone brings together the largest prisons in the world for journalists and bloggers, such as China or Vietnam, with countries among the most dangerous for the profession, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh. The Asia-Pacific region also holds the record for the greatest number of "predators of press freedom", at the head of the worst dictatorships, and in particular North Korea and Laos, true black holes of information.

## Conclusion

This 2020 World Press Freedom Index states that the coming decade is going to be decisive for press freedom due to five converging factors which can be :

* a democratic crisis due to polarization and repression
* a geopolitical crisis driven by the aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes
* an economic crisis impoverishing quality journalism
* a trust crisis due to suspicion and even hatred of the media
* a technological crisis due to a lack of democratic guarantees

To these five types of crisis is now added a health crisis. Indeed, the coronavirus epidemic has allowed us to witness a real regression of press freedom in the world, between censorship and repression of the media, disinformation but also a total and unlimited control of certain States on the media. What will the press of tomorrow look like? The future of journalism is playing out today.
