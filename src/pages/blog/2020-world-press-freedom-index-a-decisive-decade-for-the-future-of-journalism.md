description: According to RSFâ€™s measures, world press freedom improved very
  slightly in 2019. However, the flagrant attacks on the media and open
  hostility towards journalists in many democracies result in more and more
  frequent acts of violence, intimidation, but also censorship, that create
  worldwide an unprecedented state of fear.

## About the index score

The Press Freedom Index is an annual ranking of 180 countries compiled and published by Reporters Without Borders on the basis of countries' press freedom results according to the organization's own assessment. It intends to reflect the degree of freedom that journalists, news organisations, and netizens have in each country, and the efforts made by authorities to respect this freedom.

The World Press Freedom Index is composed of a number of indicators, which are :

* **Pluralism :** Measures the degree to which opinions are represented in the media.
* **Media independence :** Measures the degree to which the media are able to function independently of sources of political, governmental, business and religious power and influence.
* **Environment and self-censorship :** Analyses the environment in which news and information providers operate.
* **Legislative framework :** Measures the impact of the legislative framework governing news and information activities.
* **Transparency :** Measures the transparency of the institutions and procedures that affect the production of news and information.
* **Infrastructure :** Measures the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information.
* **Abuses :** A seventh indicator based on data gathered about abuses and acts of violence against journalists and media during the period evaluated is also factored into the calculation.

## The Index region by region

* ### Europe

  Europe remains the continent most in favor of press freedom, despite the repressive policies of certain countries of the European Union and the Balkans. Although several Member States are among those which respect press freedom the best, the EU is increasingly heterogeneous. Undermined by the successive economic crises, the fight against terrorism, but also by States sliding more and more towards a more authoritarian regime, Europe is showing itself less and less credible in this role of example that we could have given him in the past.
* ### North America

  Across North America, despite a slight improvement, worrying trends persist. Journalists and the media continue to face verbal and physical threats, denied access to information, as laws and lawsuits restricting their rights multiply. At the dawn of this new decade, the United States urgently needs to regain its credentials in terms of press freedom within and beyond its borders in order to re-position itself as a leading democracy.
* ### South America

  In South America, the decade begins with a general deterioration in the situation of press freedom. The context in which journalists in Latin America operate is increasingly complex and hostile. In addition to the increased pressure, violence and intimidation suffered by many journalists covering sensitive issues, extensive discrediting campaigns have been launched against the profession in most countries in the region.
* ### Africa

  Africa is seeing significant setbacks, due in part to an upsurge in long-term arbitrary detentions and online attacks. The situation of those who try to produce information is difficult, even critical.
* ### Asia

The Asia zone brings together the largest prisons in the world for journalists and bloggers, such as China or Vietnam, with countries among the most dangerous for the profession, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh. The Asia-Pacific region also holds the record for the greatest number of "predators of press freedom", at the head of the worst dictatorships, and in particular North Korea and Laos, true black holes of information.



## Conclusion

This 2020 World Press Freedom Index states that the coming decade is going to be decisive for press freedom due to five converging factors which can be :


* a democratic crisis due to polarization and repression
* a geopolitical crisis driven by the aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes
* an economic crisis impoverishing quality journalism
* a trust crisis due to suspicion and even hatred of the media
* a technological crisis due to a lack of democratic guarantees

To these five types of crisis is now added a health crisis. Indeed, the coronavirus epidemic has allowed us to witness a real regression of press freedom in the world, between censorship and repression of the media, disinformation but also a total and unlimited control of certain States on the media. What will the press of tomorrow look like? The future of journalism is playing out today.
